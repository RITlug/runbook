# Meetings

When
----------------
Meetings are held Friday evenings 4-6PM. Although late, the room the club meets in is consistently available
during this time so that we can keep a consistent time. Keeping a consistent time allows members to
plan their schedules around meetings.

Format
----------------
RITlug meetings are casual and often driven by interruption. The meetings are structured so that the first half of
the meeting is reserved for presentations (planned in advance). These presentations may not take up the entirety
of the first hour. This allows for presentations to run long and for questions if the club takes interest, without
necessarily constraining them to a shorter time slot than is ideal.

Presentations given by club members usually welcome interruption for questions or observations. This allows
for presentations to expand to suit the interests of those present at the meeting and often leads to interesting
tangents that would otherwise not have the opportunity to come up. Interruptions are encouraged to be polite
by waiting for a pause or bringing up questions between slides. This is not a typical way of giving presentations
so guest speakers should be warned, or the club asked to hold their questions to the end, depending on the
speaker.

The remainder of the meeting after the presentation is unstructured. This provides time for members to experiment with the topic that was
presented, raise questions and concerns, get general tech support, and openly discuss other facets of the Linux
and FOSS worlds. Occasionally, impromptu presentations may appear during this time as well.

Splitting the meeting into two sections gives members the option to stay for only one portion of the meeting.
This can be ideal for some due to classes or other scheduling. Members are free to come and go as they
feel the need. This also seems to promote learning and the club to form a community, rather than just being
a group of people who meet on a weekly basis.

Planning
---------------
Meetings should be planned in advance of the meeting with at least one presentation. Once the formal topic
of the meeting is decided, an announcement should be sent out to the club. See [Announcements](announcements.md).

Re-using previous presentations is okay, provided that they haven't been given for enough time that repeating
them will not be repetitive. RITlug publishes talks (where licensing allows) on the website and pulling
from these is permissible.

Club members may express interest in covering a particular topic and may provide their own presentations as well.

Topics
---------------
There aren't any specific restrictions for meeting topics. Topics usually are Linux-related but also can be
related to other open source technologies, or other technologies in general. Presenting about anything
is permissible as long as it is appropriate and there is interest from the club.
