# Announcements

RITlug has two main channels for sending announcements: the RITlug website, and TheLink@RIT Roster.
Announcements posted on the RITlug website are automatically emailed to the public mailing list on Google Groups.
Unfortunately, there is no current way to add the public mailing list to TheLink@RIT's mailing list or vice versa.

In order to post a club-wide announcement, create a new post on the website (see [The Website](the-website.md#announcements))
and send an email to the roster on TheLink.

Although it isn't the most fluid way of doing things, make sure all announcements are sent out through
TheLink as it seems to reach people much more effectively. TheLink roster only allows people with RIT accounts,
hence the additional Google Group. All RIT affiliated individuals should be on TheLink rather than the Google
Group.
