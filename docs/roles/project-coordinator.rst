Eboard: Project coordinator ===========================

The project coordinator is one of the elected members of the executive board
(i.e. "eboard"). The project coordinator is directly responsible for managing
different projects in the club. Sometimes, the project coordinator may act as a
project lead for a specific project. This page explains more about the
responsibilities and role of the project coordinator.


Description 
-----------

The project coordinator is responsible for ensuring that all club projects have
the resources needed to continue developing.  This may include monetary
resources, connections to mentors or the like and infrastructure to host the
projects. 

Eligibility requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project coordinator must maintain good academic standing as defined by RIT
to remain a member of eboard.  Due to the hands on nature of the role, the
project coordinator must be available in person during club and eboard
meetings.  If needed, a temporary replacement may be appointed to fill the role
while the project coordinator is out on coop. In that case there should be good
communication between the the two people in order to facilitate a smooth 
transition.
