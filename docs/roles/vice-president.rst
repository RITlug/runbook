Eboard: Vice President
======================

The vice president is one of the elected members of the executive board (i.e.
"eboard"). The vice president is directly responsible for helping the president
carry out their responsibilities and help manage the overall club. Usually, the
president and vice president maintain a close relationship where
responsibilities often swap between the two. This page explains more about the
responsibilities and role of the vice president.

The vice president assists the president where possible. This includes…

#. Writing and reviewing weekly announcement emails
