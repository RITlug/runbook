RITlug has a hosted server in the Institute Hall data center.
It is currently owned and maintained by `Solomon Rubin`_ (Serubin).
It is permanently on lend to RITlug.
He remains the primary contact for any major issues.

Management

This section is for management of resources on the hosted server.
Some parts of RITlug's infrastructure are hosted in GitHub, like our website (see :doc:`website`).

Create new VM
=============

When creating a custom VM or a new template, use this set of instructions.

#. [*General*] Set Resource Pool to `RITLUG`
#. [*General*] Set VM ID using the following notation:

   - `3xx`: Student VMs
   - `2xx`: RITlug club VMs
   - `1xx`: Solomon's private VMs (not for club use)
   - **Keep IDs incremental** if possible

#. [*General*] Give it a clear name!
#. [*OS*] Select OS
#. [*CD/DVD*] Select your ISO from the `local` storage.
#. [*Hard Disk*] Set Bus `VirtIO` and `0`
#. [*Hard Disk*] Set Format to `QEMU`
#. [*Hard Disk*] Do not change the `Cache` item
#. [*Hard Disk*] Select Size
#. [*CPU*] Set `Type` to `host`
#. [*CPU*] Set `Cores`. Do not change `Sockets`
#. [*Memory*] Use `fixed size memory`
#. [*Network*] Set `Model` to `VirtIO`
#. [*Network*] Set `MAC Addr` as necessary
#. Profit!

Create VM from Template
=======================

When creating a new VM from a templateâ€¦

#. Right click on desired template and click "Clone"
#. Set VM ID using the following notation:

   - `3xx`: Student VMs
   - `2xx`: RITlug club VMs
   - `1xx`: Solomon's private VMs (not for club use)
   - **Keep IDs incremental** if possible

#. Set `Mode` to `Full Clone`
#. Set `Resource Pool` to `RITLUG`
#. Set name and continue
#. Resize disk, modify resources as needed
#. Change MAC address in network settings.
   Use an unallocated MAC from the list on the eboard GitLab and record the new use in the list.
#. Start VM, follow any setup scripts
#. Profit!

Use and Access
**************

Use and access of Titan is limited to the President, Vice President, and Project Coordinator.
In the future, there may be opportunities for club members to participate in managing RITlug's infrastructure.

How to Gain Access to Titan
===========================

If you are one of the three roles listed above, and have not yet gained access to Titan, this is the section for you.
Access to Titan first requires access to the VPN, as Titan's Management Interface (TMI) is IP restricted.
To get on the VPN, Solomon needs to give you the OpenVPN file to initiate the connection.
This VPN does not allow anything but local traffic through, so tunneling does not work.

Lastly, TMI needs a (TMI) proxmox account. 
Proxmox is used in order to avoid unnecessary unix accounts.
This requires a username, and Solomon provides a temporary password that should be changed upon log in.
The steps for this process are listed below:

#. Start a conversation with Solomon Rubin
#. Give Solomon a username and PIN to be used with the OpenVPN connection.
#. Give a username to be used with the TMI proxmox
