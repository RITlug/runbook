Create new VM
=============

When creating a custom VM or a new template, use this set of instructions.

#. [*General*] Set Resource Pool to `RITLUG`
#. [*General*] Set VM ID using the following notation:

   - `3xx`: Student VMs
   - `2xx`: RITlug club VMs
   - `1xx`: Solomon's private VMs (not for club use)
   - **Keep IDs incremental** if possible

#. [*General*] Give it a clear name!
#. [*OS*] Select OS
#. [*CD/DVD*] Select your ISO from the `local` storage.
#. [*Hard Disk*] Set Bus `VirtIO` and `0`
#. [*Hard Disk*] Set Format to `QEMU`
#. [*Hard Disk*] Do not change the `Cache` item
#. [*Hard Disk*] Select Size
#. [*CPU*] Set `Type` to `host`
#. [*CPU*] Set `Cores`. Do not change `Sockets`
#. [*Memory*] Use `fixed size memory`
#. [*Network*] Set `Model` to `VirtIO`
#. [*Network*] Set `MAC Addr` as necessary
#. Profit!

Create VM from Template
=======================

When creating a new VM from a templateâ€¦

#. Right click on desired template and click "Clone"
#. Set VM ID using the following notation:

   - `3xx`: Student VMs
   - `2xx`: RITlug club VMs
   - `1xx`: Solomon's private VMs (not for club use)

#. Set `Mode` to `Full Clone`
#. Set `Resource Pool` to `RITLUG`
#. Set name and continue
#. Resize disk, modify resources as needed
#. Change MAC address in network settings.
   Use an unallocated MAC from the list on the eboard GitLab and record the new use in the list.
#. Start VM, follow any setup scripts
#. Profit!
