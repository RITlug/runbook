Today, the Telegram group is left online as a convenience to older members who choose to use it.
However, it is not officially advertised or endorsed by RITlug eboard.

Before switching to Slack, RITlug advertised a Telegram group and :doc:`IRC channel <irc-channel>`.
After switching to Slack and setting up a bridge, RITlug only advertised the Slack.
However, the Telegram group and IRC channel were kept online for convenience.
The work to maintain a bridge across all groups was simple: run a bot and forget.
Since this is easy to maintain, we chose to support the bridge.

Teleirc bridge
==============

The IRC bridge uses `RITlug/teleirc <https://github.com/RITlug/teleirc>`__ to run the bridge.
This service is run off of RITlug infrastructure.
See documentation for the Teleirc bridges for more information.

.. note::

   Once Teleirc bridge documentation is written, a cross-document link should be added to this section.


*****************
Moderation policy
*****************

RIT and RITlug club policy determine moderation policies.
This document is not a policy document, so it is not covered.

.. note::

   Once available, a link to those public policy documents should go here.

Administrator action
********************

.. warning::
   The following instructions are shown on the official `Telegram Desktop <https://desktop.telegram.org/>`__ application.
   If you are using another platform (iOS, Android, web, etc.), the instructions may differ.

There are two types of administrator actions: **updating administrator list** and **taking moderation action**.

Update administrator list
=========================

Existing administrators with the correct permission can add other administrators.
See the :ref:`administrator-list` for a list of existing administrators.

Follow these steps to add a `@ritlug`_ new administrator.

Take moderation action
======================

If you need to take moderation action (e.g. banning a user or deleting spam messages), use Telegram moderation tools.
The quickest way to open the moderation tools is by right-clicking or long-pressing on a specific message in Telegram.
If these options do not appear, try deleting the message first.
If successful, an interface appears with three options to enable:
