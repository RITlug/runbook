Club Fairs
==========

RIT has a number of club fairs throughout the year that RITlug can
attend in order to attract more members. Attending (or not) is at the
discretion of the active Eboard.

Staffing
--------

The RITlug table must be staffed by at least one Eboard member. Eboard
can offer staffing the table as a club involvement opportunity and any
number of members can visit or stand with RITlug.

Anyone staffing the table should be prepared to speak to people.

Setup
-----

-  Sign up for the club fair using the relevant form on TheLink.

-  Request extra chairs and access to power if needed.

-  Put up the RITlug table banner if it is available. Otherwise, try to
   have some signage on hand so the table is clearly branded as being a
   RITlug presence.

-  Create a signup sheet on Google Forms to collect the email addresses
   of anyone interested in getting involved. Email should suffice, but
   name and email can be a good idea (new students may sign up with
   their personal email).

After the Fair
--------------

-  Invite anyone who signed up with their RIT email to join RITlug on
   TheLink. TheLink offers this functionality on the Roster under the
   Invite button.

-  Email anyone who signed up with their personal email and suggest they
   join TheLink or the public mailing list for email updates. You can
   also refer them to the get-involved page on the website, or
   equivalent. Don't annoy them by emailing them repeatedly.
