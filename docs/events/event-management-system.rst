This page documents the RIT `Event Management System`_ (EMS), the system RIT
uses to enable students and student organizations to make room reservations and
requests.


**************
When it's used
**************

RIT EMS is used when you need to make a reservation for a room on RIT's campus.
Extra options are enabled on student accounts linked to a student organization.

.. hint::

   The official name for our club in RIT's system is *Linux Users Group*.

Account privileges are managed through CampusGroups (see
:doc:`../administration/campusgroups-management`). Make sure eboard members are
current for grant or revoke privileges.
