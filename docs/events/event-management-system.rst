This page documents the RIT `Event Management System`_ (EMS).
EMS is the system RIT offers to students and student organizations to make room reservations and requests.


***************
When it is used
***************

RIT EMS is used when you need to make a reservation for a room on RIT's campus.
Extra options are enabled on student accounts linked to a student organization.

.. hint::

   The official name for our club in RIT's system is *Linux Users Group*.
   Events should be entered as "Student Org Space Confirmed" to signal club office to approve them, at which point they will change to "Student Org Event Approved" (or similar).
   FYI, at time of writing the process for rooms not available normally (such as Golisano labs) is being changed, specifics unknown.

Account privileges are managed through CampusGroups (see :doc:`../administration/campusgroups-management`).
Make sure eboard members are current for grant or revoke privileges.

Issues with EMS should be emailed to studentevents@rit.edu which is maintained by a student worker.
When an event is approved you will be emailed different addresses to contact should changes be needed.
Beyond that the Tiger Suite should be visited in-person.
