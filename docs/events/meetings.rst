Meetings
========

This page covers when meetings happen, the typical RITlug meeting format and topics, how to plan and announce a meeting, and what to do following the meeting.

Note that this is a typical meeting.
RITlug holds the occasional "special" meeting which do not always follow this format (think elections and similar).

Meeting Checklist (steps are detailed later in the document)
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure an eboard member will be available and present in the room prior to the meeting (15 minutes is usually fine).
2. Plan a topic for the meeting (including creating presentations if necessary)
3. Announce the meeting topic
4. Hold the meeting! Prior to a talk, give any club announcements and introduce the presenter.
5. Post the talk to the RITlug website, if permitted
6. Ensure an Eboard member is present until the end of the meeting (or end the meeting early, if absolutely necessary)

When
----

Meetings are held Friday evenings 4-6PM.
Although late, the room the club meets in is consistently available during this time so that we can keep a consistent time.
Keeping a consistent time allows members to plan their schedules around meetings.

Format
------

RITlug meetings are casual and often driven by interruption.
The meetings are structured so that the first half of the meeting is reserved for presentations (planned in advance).
These presentations may not take up the entirety of the first hour.
This allows for presentations to run long and for questions if the club takes interest, without necessarily constraining them to a shorter time slot than is ideal.

Presentations given by club members usually welcome interruption for questions or observations.
This allows for presentations to expand to suit the interests of those present at the meeting and often leads to interesting tangents that would otherwise not have the opportunity to come up.
Interruptions are encouraged to be polite by waiting for a pause or bringing up questions between slides.
This is not a typical way of giving presentations so guest speakers should be warned, or the club asked to hold their questions to the end, depending on the speaker.

The remainder of the meeting after the presentation is unstructured.
This provides time for members to experiment with the topic that was presented, raise questions and concerns, get general tech support, and openly discuss other facets of the Linux and FOSS worlds.
Occasionally, impromptu presentations may appear during this time as well.

Splitting the meeting into two sections gives members the option to stay for only one portion of the meeting.
This can be ideal for some due to classes or other scheduling.
Members are free to come and go as they feel the need.
This also seems to promote learning and the club to form a community, rather than just being a group of people who meet on a weekly basis.

Planning and Announcing
-----------------------

Meetings should be planned in advance of the meeting with at least one presentation.
Once the formal topic of the meeting is decided, an announcement should be sent out to the club.
See `Announcements <announcements.md>`__.
As part of the announcement process is handled via Github, presenters should be encouraged to submit their announcement as a pull request against the website.
Once merged, the eboard should also copy the announcement and send it out via TheLink.
Instructions for sending an announcement are available `in the Runbook <the-website.md#announcements>`__ and can be sent with the request for an announcement.
Note that not all presenters may be willing to submit a pull request or it may not be appropriate to ask them to, so use discretion when making the request.

Re-using previous presentations is okay, provided that they haven't been given for enough time that repeating them will not be repetitive.
RITlug publishes talks (where licensing allows) on the website and pulling from these is permissible.

Club members may express interest in covering a particular topic and may provide their own presentations as well.

After the Meeting
-----------------

If the presenter agrees and licensing allows, request a PDF of the presentation from the presenter or a link to the presentation on their website.
This should be posted to the RITlug website, also using `the Runbook instructions <the-website.md#talks>`__ which is a similar process to posting announcements.
If the presenter is willing, they may submit a pull request for their own talk.
Do not post the talk without permission and appropriate licenses, ONLY post talks that RITlug is permitted to post.

If the presenter is a guest speaker, be sure to thank them for their time and offer to help them to their next destination if they are leaving the meeting.
Guests invited to RIT by RITlug should have pre and post-meeting arrangements made in advance and communicated to the guest.

Topics
------

There aren't any specific restrictions for meeting topics.
Topics usually are Linux-related but also can be related to other open source technologies, or other technologies in general.
Presenting about anything is permissible as long as it is appropriate and there is interest from the club.
