Faculty Adviser
===============

All official RIT clubs must have a faculty adviser. The faculty adviser is a
more permanent position in the club and they are not subject to annual
elections.

The faculty adviser may change at any time during the year. If this happens, a
new adviser should be found immediately (or else the club risks losing
recognition by student government). Once found, the former adviser should be
off-boarded and the new one on-boarded.


Adviser responsibilities
------------------------

Faculty advisers can take a hands-on or hands-off role. In the past, RITlug's
adviser is usually hands-off, assuming the club is well-behaved and there is
regular communication with the adviser. If a new adviser is selected, they
should meet with the current Eboard and discuss expectations.

The adviser is a point of contact for the club and RIT clubs office. Thus,
there are a few forms that the adviser must sign annually (usually at the
beginning and end of the year). Periodically, the adviser may be needed to
resolve issues with the clubs office or with renewing club resources.


Adviser on-boarding
-------------------

- Notify RIT clubs office to add new adviser to CampusGroups

    - Clubs office sends email invitation they should accept

    - Ask if other steps should be followed to bring in a new adviser, in case
      requirements by clubs office have changed [#]_

- Instruct new adviser to contact RIT clubs office (they will be sent paperwork
  to formally accept role)

- Follow Eboard on-boarding procedures for faculty adviser (see
  :doc:`eboard-onboarding-offboarding`)

- Organize formal meeting between current Eboard and new adviser to communicate
  expectations and/or concerns

.. [#] Always ask â€“ RIT clubs office often does not clearly communicate when
   requirements have changed


Adviser off-boarding
--------------------

*Note*: If off-boarding an adviser, ensure a new adviser is selected quickly,
since RITlug is an officially-recognized club and is required to have a faculty
adviser at all times.

- Contact clubs office to remove former adviser from CampusGroups

- Follow Eboard off-boarding procedures for faculty adviser (see
  :doc:`eboard-onboarding-offboarding`)

- Thank your outgoing faculty adviser for their support (getting a physical
  gift, like a thank you card signed by club members or a gift card is always a
  nice gesture)
