Club Binder
===========

The RITlug club binder is a physical source of information about the club. It
contains hard copies of the club documentation from GitHub, club accounts, and
documentation from the RIT club office.

The RITlug club binder is passed from president to president during executive
board transitions. Even though most of RITlug's documentation is available or
maintained as electronic records, the club binder should be **updated
annually**.
