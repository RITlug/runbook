Eboard transitioning
====================

This document explains how the exiting RITlug executive board (a.k.a. Eboard)
transitions to a new, incoming executive board.


On-boarding incoming Eboard
---------------------------

Elections
^^^^^^^^^

Elections are held towards the end of the spring semester. Running an annual
election is required by the club office and should never be skipped. Follow
these steps to execute an election.

*Note*: Elections can also be held in the fall if a seat is left vacant.

- **Week 10**: Open call for nominations
  
    - Open call for nominations, for club members to nominate others in the
      community to nominate others for Eboard positions
  
    - Verify / confirm nominations with nominees
  
    - Accept nominations in a Google Drive form

- **Week 12**: Hold elections during club meeting

    - At start of Week 12, open election with all nominated candidates
    
    - Accept votes in a Google Drive form that requires logins to vote (to
      prevent voter fraud); remind club members that voting is anonymous
    
    - After accepting votes, close form, tally responses
    
    - At Week 12 meeting, announce results and display anonymized results to
      club members in room
    
    - After announcing winners, current Eboard should **permanently delete**
      the data associated with voting form (to protect voter identity)

Don't forget to congratulate all nominees for their participation in the
election.


CampusGroups roles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All RIT clubs are required to use CampusGroups and maintain records there for
the clubs office. After holding an election, update the incoming Eboard members
inside of CampusGroups.

Detailed documentation on CampusGroups can be found on the
:doc:`campusgroups-management` page.


Introduce faculty adviser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Outgoing Eboard members should help incoming members maintain a relationship
with the faculty adviser. Arrange a meeting time for the outgoing and incoming
Eboard members to meet with the faculty adviser.

See more information on the :doc:`faculty-adviser` page.


Other on-boarding tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Grant operator privileges to incoming Eboard members in the IRC channel (see
  how in :doc:`../infrastructure/irc-channel`).

- Add incoming Eboard members as admins to `Facebook group`_

- Transfer ownership of RIT computer account for RITlug (i.e. ritlug at rit dot
  edu)

- Add incoming Eboard to new Eboard team in GitHub organization, archive old
  Eboard team, grant ownership privileges to president / vice president (see
  :doc:`github-org` for detailed information)

- Share this Runbook with incoming Eboard members, encourage questions and
  feedback on improving the Runbook

- *If new president*:
    
    - Pass off club binder at club office to new president

    - Transfer ownership of Google Drive folder to new president

- Add incoming Eboard members as collaborators with write access to the RITlug
  Google Drive folder

- Incoming Eboard members should take financial certification test from RIT
  clubs office (all Eboard members **must be certified** to use club funds)

Off-boarding outgoing Eboard
----------------------------

These tasks are done at the discretion of the incoming Eboard members. All
steps are highly recommended, but are not required. Use best judgment for
whether access should be revoked (especially if outgoing members remain active
members of RITlug).

1. Revoke account privileges from any RITlug-owned machines or servers
2. Remove outgoing members from current "Eboard" team in GitHub, remove
   ownership rights if they have it
3. Revoke admin privileges on Facebook group
4. Remove channel operator privileges on IRC (optionally can grant voice
   privileges)
5. Remove permissions / roles in CampusGroups (see
   :doc:`campusgroups-management` for more information)
6. Revoke privileges in RITlug Google Drive folder
7. Transfer account ownership of RIT computer account, update any info and
   reset password (if necessary)
