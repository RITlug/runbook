Eboard Member Offboarding
=========================

*These can be done at the discretion of the incoming eboard. In the
history of the club, former eboard members who continue to be active
members often retain access to various things.*

1. Revoke sudo access from the departing eboard member from the servers
2. Remove departing eboard members from the Eboard team on Github (and
   revoke ownership if they have it)
3. Revoke admin access on the Facebook group from the departing eboard
   member
4. `Revoke Op privileges on the IRC channel from the departing eboard
   member <irc-channel.md#managing-access>`__
5. `Remove departing members from their eboard roles on
   TheLink <thelink-roster.md#updating-eboard-roles>`__ (they can remain
   members, no need to remove them completely)
6. Remove departing members from the Eboard Google Drive folder
7. Transfer account ownership of club accounts administered by eboard
   members where necessary by updating information and resetting the
   password.
