This document explains how the exiting RITlug executive board (a.k.a. *eboard*) transitions to a new, incoming executive board.


***************************
On-boarding incoming eboard
***************************

These steps explain how to on-board new members to the RITlug eboard.

Hold elections
==============

Elections are held towards the end of the spring semester.
Running an annual election is required by the club office and should never be skipped.
Follow these steps to execute an election.

*Note*: Elections can also be held in the fall if a seat is left vacant.

- **Week 10**: Open call for nominations
  
    - Open call for nominations: club members nominate others in community for eboard positions
  
    - Verify / confirm nominations with nominees
  
    - Accept nominations in a Google Drive form

- **Week 12**: Hold elections during club meeting

    - At start of Week 12 (Monday), open election with nominated candidates
    
    - Create CampusGroups survey to accept votes (see :doc:`campusgroups-management` for more info); remind club members that voting is anonymous
    
    - Close form at end of Week 12 (Sunday)

    - Current eboard members reach out to winning members to confirm their acceptance of role
    
    - At Week 13 meeting, announce results to club members in room; follow-up with an email announcment after

Congratulate all nominees for their participation in the election.

Update CampusGroups roles
=========================

RIT clubs are required to use CampusGroups and maintain records for the clubs office.
After holding an election, update the incoming eboard members inside of CampusGroups.

Detailed documentation on CampusGroups can be found on the :doc:`campusgroups-management` page.

Update email aliases
====================

RITlug uses different email aliases for different uses in the club.
At the end of the semester, outgoing eboard members should replace their aliases with incoming eboard members.
This is required for email aliases intended for a single role (e.g. ``president@ritlug.com``, ``secretary@ritlug.com``, etc.).
For project aliases (e.g. ``tigeros@ritlug.com``), it is up to the discretion of an individual and the project team if they wish to remain on the alias.

Detailed documentation on updating email aliases is found on the :doc:`../tasks/update-email-aliases` page.

Introduce faculty adviser
=========================

Outgoing eboard members help incoming members maintain a relationship with the faculty adviser.
Arrange a meeting time for the outgoing and incoming eboard members to meet with the faculty adviser.
