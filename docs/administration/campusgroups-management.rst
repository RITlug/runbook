Managing CampusGroups

`CampusGroups`_ is the club management platform provided by RIT Clubs office.

documents routine actions or maintenance work to manage the RITlug CampusGroups
profile.

CampusGroups has an Officers page used by RIT Clubs office to recognize club
leadership and assign RIT web service permissions (see
:doc:`../events/event-management-system`) as needed. The page is under the
*Dashboard* menu.

RITlug recognizes these positions on our executive board:

- President (*required*)
- Vice president
- Treasurer (*required*)
- Secretary
- Officer (*role varies*)
- Faculty advisor

Permissioning
=============

All eboard officers should be listed as *Active Officer* and *Visible on
Website*.

The president, vice president, and faculty advisor(s) should be listed as *Main
contact*.

Add eboard member
=================

Begin from the *Officers* page for RITlug in CampusGroups. A member-elect must
join the RITlug organization in CampusGroups first to appear in the interface.

#. Click *Add Officer* in upper-right corner
#. Search by name or RIT email address for the member-elect
#. Check `Notify each new officer by email`, click *Submit*
#. They should appear on the *Officers* page
#. Update their position, custom position, and permissions as needed

Remove eboard member
====================

.. note::

   This has never been done before in CampusGroups! When done next, it should be
   documented here.


****************
Maintain records
****************

RITlug does not use many features of CampusGroups because we already have some
tools or systems in place. However, RIT Clubs office uses CampusGroups as a
primary electronic data source for RIT student organizations. Therefore,
information should be current.

Address
=======

- **Group email**: Email alias to reach all eboard members

- **Address**: Current club mailing address provided by RIT Clubs office

- **Phone**: Phone number of current president

Other records
=============

Other records are either not regularly updated or not used. Future eboards may
choose to utilize CampusGroups in more detail.


**************
Hold elections
**************

Eboard elections must be held via CampusGroups. This is to combat corruption and
embezzlement of RIT Clubs funding. CampusGroups standardizes student
organization elections for consistency and fairness.

Elections are a special type of survey in the *Surveys* menu.
