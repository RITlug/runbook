Managing CampusGroups
=====================

*This page still refers to TheLink, the former platform used by RIT clubs
office for managing clubs. This documentation is still outdated and needs to
be rewritten for CampusGroups, the new platform deployed by RIT clubs office.*

TheLink is the source of truth for the clubs office and students to get
in touch with club leadership and club affairs. It needs to be updated
when Eboard members or positions change.

Positions Used By RITlug
------------------------

-  President
-  Vice President
-  Secretary
-  Treasurer
-  Faculty Adviser (managed by the clubs office)
-  Eboard Member (appointed Eboard staff with access to management
   features)
-  Member (club members without access to Eboard features) *primary
   contact is not a "position"*

Positions can be updated, added, and removed as necessary and can have
differing permissions. President, Vice President, Secretary, and
Treasurer are required. Multiple people can hold the same position,
where allowed by the club constitution.

Updating the Primary Contact
----------------------------

1. Sign into TheLink
2. Go to https://thelink.rit.edu/organization/Linux/roster/manage. If
   that doesn't work, go to the RITlug organization, click the "Roster"
   tab, and click the "Manage Roster" button.
3. Click the edit button in the top right corner of the "Primary
   Contact" box
4. Search for the new primary contact and click "Select" next to their
   name

Updating Eboard Roles
---------------------

Who's in what role.

1. Sign into TheLink
2. Go to https://thelink.rit.edu/organization/Linux/roster/manage. If
   that doesn't work, go to the RITlug organization, click the "Roster"
   tab, and click the "Manage Roster" button.
3. Search for the member to update. Searching by full name doesn't
   always find the person so search by last name.
4. Click "Edit Positions" next to their name
5. Check the boxes and click "Save"

Updating Positions
------------------

What positions exist and what they have access to.

1. Sign into TheLink
2. Go to https://thelink.rit.edu/organization/Linux/positions. If that
   doesn't work, go to the RITlug organization, click the "Roster" tab,
   and click the "Manage Positions" button.

-  To add a position, click the "+ Position" button on the left.

-  To edit a position (including its permissions), click the name of the
   position.

TheLink allows granular permissions to the organization management
features and allows choosing whether position holders are shown
publicly.
