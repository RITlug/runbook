Managing CampusGroups

CampusGroups has an Officers page used by RIT Clubs office to recognize club leadership and assign RIT web service permissions (see :doc:`../events/event-management-system`) as needed.
The page is under the *Dashboard* menu.

Add eboard member
=================

Begin from the *Officers* page for RITlug in CampusGroups.
A member-elect must join the RITlug organization in CampusGroups first to appear in the interface.

#. Click *Add Officer* in upper-right corner
#. Search by name or RIT email address for the member-elect
#. Check `Notify each new officer by email`, click *Submit*
#. They should appear on the *Officers* page
#. Update their position, custom position, and permissions as needed

Remove eboard member
====================

.. note::

   This has never been done before in CampusGroups! When done next, it should be documented here.


****************
Maintain records
****************

RITlug does not use many features of CampusGroups because we already have some tools or systems in place.
However, RIT Clubs office uses CampusGroups as a primary electronic data source for RIT student organizations.
Therefore, information should be current.

Address
=======

- **Group email**: Email alias to reach all eboard members

- **Address**: Current club mailing address provided by RIT Clubs office

- **Phone**: Phone number of current president

Other records
=============

Other records are either not regularly updated or not used.
Future eboards may choose to utilize CampusGroups in more detail.


**************
Hold elections
**************

Elections must be held via CampusGroups.
This is to combat corruption and embezzlement of RIT Clubs funding.
CampusGroups standardizes student organization elections for consistency and fairness.

Elections are a special type of survey in the *Surveys* menu.
Refer to `CampusGroups documentation <https://help.campusgroups.com/forms-and-surveys/running-elections-for-your-group>`_ to create elections in CampusGroups.

Election execution
==================

   See :doc:`eboard-onboarding-offboarding` for more information on election execution and policy.
