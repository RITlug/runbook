# RITlug Faculty Adviser

The RIT clubs office requires all SG clubs to have a faculty adviser. Faculty
advisers are typically more permanent than Eboard members as they are not
subject to the annual election process.

Faculty advisers may change without much notice at any point during the year.
In the event that this happens, a new faculty adviser should be sought as
quickly as possible. Once found, the former adviser should be offboarded and
the new one onboarded.

## Adviser Responsibilities

The RITlug faculty adviser may take on a role that is as hands-on or hands-off
as they see fit. In the past, RITlug's advisers have been relatively hands-off
provided that the club is well-behaved and that communication with the
adviser is open. Ideally, when a new adviser is joining the club they should
speak to the current eboard (it is the responsibility of the eboard team to
faciliate this) and lay out any expectations that they have.

Beyond the role that the faculty adviser chooses to have, the adviser is one
of the points of contact that the clubs office has for the club. There are
a few annual forms that the adviser needs to review and sign, usually at the
beginning and end of the year, which are not overly extensive. Periodically,
the eboard team may need the adviser to help resolve issues with the clubs
office which may revolve around renewing club resources or reminding the clubs
office of the existence of the club.

## Faculty Adviser Onboarding Process (to be followed by the Eboard team)

* Speak to the clubs office so that they can add the new adviser to TheLink.
This will send the adviser an email invitation which they should accept. Make
sure to inquire about other requirements for bringing in a new adviser.
* Have the new adviser contact the RIT clubs office, as they will need to sign
some paperwork to formally accept the role.
* Follow [the eboard member onboarding process](eboard-onboarding-offboarding.md#eboard-member-onboarding)
_Note that RIT faculty may request access to club resources such as Google Drive
via an alternate email account._
* Set up a formal meeting between the eboard team and new adviser so they may
communicate their expectations and concerns

## Faculty Adviser Offboarding Process (to be followed by the Eboard team)

_Note that RITlug is a SG club and is therefore required to have a faculty
adviser at all times._

* Speak to the clubs office so they can remove the former adviser from TheLink.
* Follow [the eboard member offboarding process](eboard-onboarding-offboarding.md#eboard-member-offboarding)
* If possible, make sure to thank the former adviser for their support
