This guide explains how to create a meeting sign-in form on CampusGroups.
Every meeting should have a sign-in form to track attendance and log club activity.
This activity is used by RIT clubs office to determine club engagement (relevant for budget allocation).

Sign-in forms are tied to CampusGroups Events (found under the *Events* tab on the organization page).
Regular meetings are created automatically via RIT's Event Management System (see :doc:`../events/event-management-system`).
RITlug eboard members do not need to manually create meetings.
