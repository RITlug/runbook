Update email aliases
####################

RITlug eboard members use various email aliases for communication.
Most of these emails are used for external communication outside of the RITlug community.
This procedure explains how to change or add email aliases and point them to different emails.

Pre-requisites

* `Namecheap <https://namecheap.com/>`__ access to ritlug.com domain [#]_
* Preferred email address for anyone being added to an alias

These instructions explain how to find email alias configuration in the Namecheap interface.
Further instructions assume you know how to find these.

After logging in to Namecheap, locate the *Domain List*.
Click the *Manage* button next to the ritlug.com domain.
The domain overview page, shown below, will appear.
