Announcements
=============

You mean there's more than place for announcements?
---------------------------------------------------

As of 2017, RITlug has three main channels for sending announcements:
the RITlug website (a.k.a. Google Groups), TheLink@RIT, and a Mailchimp
mailing list. Announcements posted on the RITlug website (via git) are
automatically emailed to the public mailing list on Google Groups. IFTTT
picks up the git commit and posts it to the Google Groups mailing list.
Mailchimp was started during fall 2017 during the Club Fair, but it
should be avoided if possible. Unfortunately, there is no current way to
add to the private TheLink@RIT mailing list (or vice versa).

In order to post a club-wide announcement, create a new post on the
website (see `The Website <the-website.md#announcements>`__) **first**.
Commit and push the post. Then, take the text and paste it into an email
to the roster on TheLink. You can also take a copy and pasted version to
Mailchimp as well.

Although it isn't the most fluid way of doing things, make sure all
announcements are sent out through TheLink as it seems to reach people
much more effectively (it's also our largest mailing list of the three).
TheLink roster only allows people with RIT accounts, hence the
additional Google Groups and Mailchimp lists. All RIT-affiliated
individuals should be on TheLink rather than Google Groups.
