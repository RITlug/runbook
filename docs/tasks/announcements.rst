How to send email announcements
###############################

As of 2018, there is only one place to write announcements: :doc:`CampusGroups <../administration/campusgroups-management>`.
Announcements are generally sent to RITlug club members at the beginning of each week.
These weekly emails inform club members about the topic of the upcoming general meeting.

In order to post a club-wide announcement, you need to navigate to the RITlug `CampusGroups <https://campusgroups.rit.edu>`__ page.
On the main club page, go to the *Emails* drop-down, and select the *Mailing Lists* option.
To send an email from here, one must:

#. Select mailing list
#. Choose sender email address
#. Select email template
#. Compose email
#. Send email

Here, you will be asked which mailing list you would like to send the email to.

Weekly emails should always be sent from the **eboard [at] ritlug [dot] com** email address.

.. note:: For debugging purposes, it is good to know this is *technically* a "Reply-To" header

**********************
Composing weekly email
**********************

1. Add a title ( usual format: *RITlug Week # Meeting -- Meeting Topic* )
2. Select email template

Currently, there are two templates: *RITlug Welcome Email*, and *RITlug Newsletter*. 
For general RITlug meetings, choose *RITlug Newsletter*

At this point, you are free to create the RITlug General Meeting email from the given template.

Adding events
*************

After the email is all drafted and completed, it is a good idea to have a *RITlug Meeting* Event to add to the email.

Sending email
*************

The last step is sending out the email. 
CampusGroups has the nifty option to send the email out at a certain time (This can be helpful if the email is being composed in the middle of the night).
The *Hide default signature* option should be selected so there is no odd *Linux Users Group* footer at the end of each email.

Lastly, at the very bottom, the option exists to send a test email, preview the composed email, save as draft, or send!
Congratulations, you've now successfully sent out an email to all RITlug members!
