# Club Binder
The RITlug club binder is a physical source of information about the club.
It contains hard copies of the club documentation from Github, club accounts,
and documentation from the clubs office.

As most of RITlug's documentation is available or maintained as electronic
records, the RITlug binder is primarily a token passed from president to
president. Even so, it should be kept up to date as an offline mirror of
RITlug's documents. At a minimum, it should be updated annually.

## Contents
See [Club Binder Contents](club-binder-contents.md), kept as a separate
file so it can be used as the actual table of contents in the binder.

## Updating the Club Binder

1. Print the documents, using the instructions below.
2. Replace the updated pages in the club binder
3. Update the log at the front of the section you updated

### Printing Markdown Documents

* [http://www.markdowntopdf.com/](http://www.markdowntopdf.com/) is a great
resource for converting markdown to a more printable format. Upload the pages
you need converted and it will immediately give you back a PDF that you can
print.

* To save on paper, try to print only the pages that have been updated

### Club Governance

* Clone the governance repository, install the dependencies, and compile the
documents, as explained in the README.md in that repository.

* Print the PDFs. Once again, try to print only the pages that have been
updated.

### Club Accounts

* Request a copy of the RITlug budget report from the clubs office. Print the
sheets from the document as needed.
