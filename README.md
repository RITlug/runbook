Detailed information on how to run and manage the RIT Linux Users Group (RITlug)


## About

This repository documents information about how RITlug is managed and operated
by executive board (eboard) members. The Runbook helps for eboard on-boarding /
off-boarding and following up with routine tasks.

The Runbook is a living collection of documents that evolves as club operations
change.

#### What this is not

The Runbook is not the same as club governance documents (e.g. constitution).
See [RITlug/governance](https://github.com/RITlug/governance) for "legal"
documents recognized by RIT Clubs office.

**Private information (e.g. credentials, RIT private information, etc.) belongs
in the Runbook.**


## Who

The Runbook is intended as a resource for the RITlug eboard. Club members are
welcomed and encouraged to read the Runbook and make suggestions.

The Runbook is officially maintained by RITlug's secretary (in the event of no
secretary, then president). However, all eboard members should update their
processes or knowledge areas on an ongoing basis.

contents is available there.
