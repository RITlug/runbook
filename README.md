Wut? Why?
----------
This repository holds information about how RITlug works from an Eboard standpoint. The runbook is intended to be a source of information for how to do anything RITlug so that new Eboard members can pick up the reigns without needing to be inundated with tribal knowledge. In the past, RITlug's practices have largely been communicated by word of mouth which has made it difficult for new Eboard members to get adjusted and caused some things to get lost in the transitions.

The Runbook is intended to be a living collection of documents that evolve as club operations change.

This runbook is not the same as the club governance documents. The governance documents are the "legal" documents that govern official club policy and that are submitted to the RIT clubs office for approval when changed. The documents in this repository are for RITlug leadership to maintain independently and update as necessary so that the processes RITlug has developed (which abide by the policies in the governing documents) are documented. This runbook holds things such as meeting formats, how to send announcements, accounts held by the club, and various other things.

**No club secrets such as credentials, budget information, or other club/RIT private information should be documented here.**

Who?
----------
The Runbook is aimed at the RITlug Eboard. Club members are encouraged to read, open issues on, and submit pull requests (suggestions) to the Runbook.

Eboard members can update their processes and the Runbook as they deem necessary.
